The Boy & His Dog
-----------------

The boy and his dog are best friends.  They go everywhere together.

One day they went out into a field and the boy found a stick.  He threw
the stick for his dog, and his dog gladly chased it and brought it back.

They played fetch for several hours in that field until they were tired.
They found a tree to take a nap under.  The dog laid down, and the boy rested
his head on the dog.

They had a great nap together.

The end.
